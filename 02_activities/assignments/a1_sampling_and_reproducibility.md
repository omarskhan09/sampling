# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 1000 (from the original 50000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitbyâ€™s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

1. Initial Population Sampling:
Function: simulate_event(m)
Procedure: Creates a population of 1,000 individuals, with 200 attending weddings and 800 attending brunches.
Sample Size: 1,000 individuals.
Sampling Frame: Attendees of weddings and brunches.
2. Infection Sampling:
Function: simulate_event(m)
Procedure: A random 10% subset (100 individuals) of the population is infected, based on the ATTACK_RATE (10%).
Sample Size: 100 individuals.
Underlying Distribution: Binomial distribution (10% chance of infection for each individual).
3. Primary Contact Tracing:
Function: simulate_event(m)
Procedure: A 20% subset of infected individuals is traced based on the TRACE_SUCCESS rate.
Sample Size: 20% of infected individuals (approximately 20).
Underlying Distribution: Binomial distribution (20% chance of being traced).
4. Secondary Contact Tracing:
Function: simulate_event(m)
Procedure: If more than 2 traced individuals are at an event, all infected attendees at that event are traced.
Sample Size: Variable, depending on traced individuals exceeding the threshold.
Underlying Distribution: Conditional on primary tracing; no fixed distribution.
Relation to the Blog Post:
Whitbyâ€™s blog highlights the bias in contact tracing, as certain events (e.g., weddings) are more easily traced than others (e.g., private gatherings). The simulation mirrors this by over-representing certain events in the traceable sample, reflecting real-world biases in contact tracing. This bias distorts the perceived infection sources, just as discussed in the blog.

Reproducing the Graphs from the Blog Post
Original Graph Comparison:
The script partially reproduces the blogâ€™s graph, but with key differences:

Blog Post Graph: Shows a "True proportion" tightly clustered around 0.2, while the "Observed proportion" spreads from 0.2 to 0.6, indicating significant bias in the observed data.
Code Output: The observed proportions are tightly clustered around 0.15â€“0.25, with minimal spread, suggesting that the observed data closely matches the true data, implying less bias than shown in the blog.
The difference could stem from variations in simulation parameters or random factors in the code.

Reproducibility with 1,000 Repetitions
When reducing repetitions from 50,000 to 1,000:

Consistent Shape: The histograms maintain consistent central tendencies, with peaks around 0.15â€“0.25 for both "Traced to Weddings" and "Infections from Weddings."
Increased Variability: Although the central trends are consistent, the specific shapes and peaks of the histograms vary due to fewer repetitions, which increases the sample variability.
Without a fixed random seed, results can fluctuate more with fewer repetitions. Increasing the number of repetitions reduces variability, leading to more stable results.

Making the Code Reproducible
To ensure reproducibility, the following changes were made:

Global Random Seed:
Added np.random.seed(10) at the beginning to control random processes (e.g., infection and tracing) and ensure consistent results across runs.
Parameterized Repetitions:
The number of repetitions (num_repetitions) is now passed to the run_simulation_and_plot() function, making it easier to adjust the number of simulations without altering the code logic.
These changes ensure that the simulation produces identical results each time it is run, making the script reproducible.
