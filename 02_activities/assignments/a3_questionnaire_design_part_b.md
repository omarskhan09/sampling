# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    The quality of the sample and its representativeness depend on the sampling technique and whether the survey reaches a broad and diverse range of respondents. If the sample is not random or if it‚Äôs skewed towards certain demographics or political leanings, the results may not accurately reflect the preferences of the general population
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```

Changes

1.On a scale of 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with the current performance of our party and its leader? (1 being very dissatisfied, 5 being very satisfied)

(1) Very Dissatisfied

(2) Dissatisfied

(3) Neutral/Not Sure

(4) Satisfied

(5) Very Satisfied

Reasoning: The original scale may cause some respondents to select an extreme response if they aren't sure about their level of satisfaction, leading to skewed data. A neutral option allows for more accurate responses from those who have no strong opinion.


2. How likely are you to vote in the upcoming election?
Very likely
Somewhat likely
Undecided
Somewhat unlikely
Very unlikely
I do not plan to vote

Reasoning: Including an option like "I do not plan to vote" allows for more accurate data from respondents who may be disengaged from the election process. The original version may have caused some to answer in a way that suggests they are already committed to voting for the party, which isn't reflective of all potential respondents.

3.Which of the following issues do you consider the most important in this federal election? (Please select up to 3 issues)
Economy and job creation
Healthcare and public health
Climate change and environmental policies
National security and defense
Housing affordability
Indigenous rights and reconciliation
Education and youth opportunities
Other (please specify)
If you selected "Other", please specify:

Reasoning: The list might miss important issues, and an "Other" option allows respondents to identify factors relevant to them but not covered by the predetermined list. It‚Äôs also important to make the wording of the "Other" option clear so that responses remain meaningful.

4. Based on our party's current platform, what specific policy areas would you like our party to focus on in the final month of the campaign? (Select all that apply)

Reasoning: The original phrasing could lead to confusion, as it does not clarify whether the respondent should suggest new policy areas or choose from existing ones. Clarifying that the options should be based on the party‚Äôs current platform keeps the focus relevant and within the context of the campaign.

5. Would you be more likely to vote for our party if we promised to implement the following in the first 100 days after the election? (Select all that apply)

( ) Reducing taxes for middle-class families
( ) A national housing affordability program
( ) Strengthening social services
( ) National climate change action plan
( ) Increased healthcare funding
( ) Other (please specify)
( ) Not Applicable (I do not feel any of these promises would affect my decision)

Reasoning: Adding a ‚ÄúNot Applicable‚Äù option allows for more accurate data from respondents who may not agree with any of the proposals or who may not feel these promises are relevant to their decision-making process.


3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
     An observational study could provide valuable contextual insights or help validate some of the survey findings (e.g., observing voting patterns or public engagement), it would not be able to fully replace the survey for gathering self-reported opinions, preferences, and policy priorities. The survey allows for precise, direct questions that capture individual subjective views, which an observational study cannot achieve without considerable inference.
    ```

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric
