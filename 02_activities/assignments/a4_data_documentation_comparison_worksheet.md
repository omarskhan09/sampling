| Sample type                                           |Stratified, cross-sectional sample of Canadian households, selected by stratified probability sampling.                                                                                            |Stratified online panel sample with a modified rolling-cross section.                                             |Captured Glossophaga soricina individuals for behavioral and dietary analysis along with faecal samples for dietary.                                                                                             |
| Sample size                                           |Approximately 50,000 units, with around 24,000 expected completed questionnaires.                                                                                            |Pre-election survey (CPS): 37,822 respondents; Post-election survey (PES): a subset of 10,337 respondents from the CPS were re-contacted.                                             |The sample included 112 G. soricina (73 females, 39 males) individuals, from which 38 faecal samples were obtained for dietary analysis.                                                                                             |
| Target population                                     |Persons aged 15 and older in the ten provinces of Canada, excluding full-time (residing for more than six months) residents of institutions.                                                                                            |Canadian citizens and permanent residents aged 18 or older.                                             |he target population was Glossophaga soricina, a nectarivorous bat species known for dietary flexibility, captured in Costa Rica.                                                                                             |
| Sampling frame                                        |Combined landline and cellular phone numbers from the Census and various administrative sources with Statistics Canada's dwelling frame.                                                                                            |Online panel members were recruited through Qualtrics. Panel quotas were set for gender, age, region, and language.                                             |Bats were captured in the field, specifically targeting G. soricina individuals in their natural habitat.                                                                                             |
| Survey mode(s)                                        |Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) and an electronic questionnaire.                                                                                            |The surveys were conducted online via the Qualtrics platform.                                             |Data collection involved field observations, faecal sample collection for DNA analysis, and behavioral experiments in a controlled flight room.                                                                                             |
| Timeline                                              |Conducted every 5 years; data collection for 2018 was from September 4 to December 28.                                                                                            |Campaign Period Survey: September 13 to October 21, 2019; Post-election survey: October 24 to November 11, 2019.                                             |The G. soricina individuals were captured from May to early July 2009, but the study does not specify a detailed timeline for behavioral and dietary study.                                                                                             |
| Response rate                                         |41.9%.                                                                                            |The source document does not specify the response rate directly, but since Qualtrics increased daily targets towards the end of the CPS period, this suggests a lower-than-anticipated response rate.                                             |No formal response rate is reported, but the faecal sample yield was 38 out of 112 captured individuals, with a subset used in behavioral experiments.                                                                                             |
| Weights                                               |Weighted factors (WGHT_PER) are used for person-level analysis, with additional bootstrap weights for variance estimation.                                                                                            |The dataset includes weights based on age, gender, education, and provincial distributions to ensure representativeness.                                             |The study does not mention using statistical weights, as it primarily presents observational and experimental data from sampled individuals.                                                                                             |
| Data processing                                       |Includes error detection via CATI system, manual and automated edits, and high-quality assurance across processing stages.                                                                                            |Data processing involved organizing responses from the Campaign Period Survey (CPS) and Post-Election Survey (PES) collected via Qualtrics. Responses were matched between surveys using panel IDs, supplemented by IP address, year of birth, and province. The final dataset integrated matched responses, ensuring longitudinal consistency.                                             |Dietary data were processed using DNA sequencing of faecal samples to identify insect species, and echolocation calls were analyzed for acoustic modeling.                                                                                             |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.                            |Imputation through donor records for missing data, with nine imputation steps including for income and volunteering variables.                                                                                            |Data cleaning included removing ineligible participants (e.g., non-Canadians, under 18), speeders, straightliners, and respondents with postal code-province mismatches. Duplicates were flagged based on IP and demographics, retaining the first response. “Inattentive” respondents (completion over 60 minutes) and “initial duplicates” were flagged but included.                                             |The study involved minimal data cleaning due to the nature of direct observational data; however, DNA analysis excluded inconclusive sequences.                                                                                             |
| Sources of error                                      |Sampling and non-sampling errors, including coverage errors, non-response bias, response errors, measurement errors, and processing errors.                                                                                            |Sampling Error: exclusion of territories limits representation; Non-sampling errors, including response bias (speeders, straightliners, and inattentive respondents, while filtered or flagged, may still affect data), measurement errors (demographic-based matching in the PES increases potential for mismatches) and processing errors.                                             |Sampling and non-sampling errors, including limited sample representation due to incomplete faecal collection, possible behavioral alterations in captivity, modeling errors, data processing errors and human errors.                                                                                             |
| Limitations, known biases                             |Excludes households without phones; nonresponse adjustments were made but may still introduce minor biases.                                                                                            |The study’s online sample lacks a traditional response rate and might underrepresent less internet-active populations. Limitations include the exclusion of territories, potential data quality issues from flagged inattentive responses, and inconsistent daily sample sizes during the campaign. French representation outside Quebec may also be limited.                                             |Known biases include underrepresentation of nectar-only diets (due to limited faecal pellet production) and potential bias in echolocation intensity measurements due to confinement in the flight room.                                                                                             |
